## A Causal Question to Study

I want to study the relationship between social mobility and number of deaths due to Covid-19: can reduced social mobility decrease the number of deaths due to Covid-19? How many deaths would have occurred if an intervention (e.g. closing the school, quarantine, ...) had been applied? Although the Covid-19 pandemic has already ended, these questions are still important to study in order to better prepare for the next potential global pandemic in the future.

We model this problem as a longitudinal setting with a stochastic process $(A_t,I_t,Y_t)(t=1,2,\cdots)$, where 
$$A_t:\ \text{social mobility on week t}$$
  &I_t:\ \text{new infections in week t}\\
  &Y_t:\ \text{the number of deaths due to Covid-19 on week t}
\end{align}
